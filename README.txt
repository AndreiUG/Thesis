												RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR TOURISM



	Recommendation System for Tourism is a Web Application that is designed to help the people to find the best place where to spend their vacation by their preferences. The client has to choose a country, a city or a zone where he wants to spend his vacation and he will need to add some preferences.
For this Recommendation System for Tourism, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end of the site and XAMPP, PHP for Database connection. For the backend part I didn’t start and I didn’t choose a language yet.

	I choose those because I already knew how to use them and had some project made with the same technologies.

	For this project if you want to run it on you’re computer you will need to install some applications.
	
	For the Frontend part I used Notepad++, in order to edit my code and to create the pages, but you can also use Notepad.

	For Database I used XAMPP and PHP(You can take any idle you want, I used PHP Storm: https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm)
		* https://www.apachefriends.org 
	
	After the installation in order to open the project you will need to open XAMPP first, then you need to Start Apache and MySql.

	After that you will have to copy-paste the folder “Source-code” in the “C:\xampp\htdocs” and open the PHP files from “Backend” folder. You need to check if the path its correct.

	Open any browser(Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.) and copy-paste in the search bar http://localhost/Source-code/Frontend/index.html .
	
	For now you can Log In and Register on the website. The other futures are not available. New ideas proposed by me consist of a section for the people that are going to plan a Business Trip. They will receive some discounts, offers for nearby attractions in the free time, free taxi from airport. Another idea is to have an optimized route, where we create a route from the hotel with some Attractions, Restaurants, Historical Sites or Shopping stores. The customer will also be able to add a stay to their favorite. For implementation, I started to add Flights, Hotels, and make the button redirect to other pages. After that I need to implement algorithms such as optimized route and recommendation.
